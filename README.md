# NLP-Imessage-Data
This repo is built off of https://github.com/my-other-github-account/imessage_tools/tree/master. In this repo I perform NLP on my iMessage data from 2023 group message. 


If you would like to replicate my exact project follow these steps below: 
1. git clone 
2. create a Conda enviorment
    a. conda create --name iMessage python=3.11
    b. conda activate iMessage
    c. pip install -r requirements.txt
3. change the notebook evniorment to the conda enviorment: https://docs.anaconda.com/ae-notebooks/user-guide/adv-tasks/work-with-environments/#:~:text=Whether%20you%20have%20created%20an,Kernel%20menu%2C%20select%20Change%20Kernel.
